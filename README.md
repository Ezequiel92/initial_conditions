Initial conditions for hydrodynamical simulations.

# Arepo

- ICs: Initial conditions for Arepo in `ICFormat = 3` (HDF5). The number in the filename indicates the number of dark matter particles in one dimension, e.g. `isolated_32.hdf5` has $32^3$ dark matter particles and $ > 32^3$ gas cells (the extra ones are the background cells, with negligible density). The ICs in `large_box` where constructed with the GalIC parameters: `OutermostBinEnclosedMassFraction` = 0.999, and `InnermostBinEnclosedMassFraction` = 0.0000001 (resulting in `BoxSize` = 300000), while the ICs in small_box used: `OutermostBinEnclosedMassFraction` = 0.9, and `InnermostBinEnclosedMassFraction` = 0.00001 (resulting in `BoxSize` = 3000).
- ic_gen: Code to generate and transform ICs.

# Gadget

- ICs:
  - Initial conditions for P-Gadget3 in `ICFormat = 1` (binary files). The number in the filename indicates the number of particles in one dimension, e.g. `gassphere_32.dat` has $\sim 32^3 / 2$ dark matter particles and $\sim 32^3 / 2$ gas particles.
  - Initial conditions for P-Gadget3 in `ICFormat = 3` (HDF5), with only dark matter particles. The number in the filename indicates the number of dark matter particles in one dimension, e.g. `dm_32.hdf5` has $32^3$ dark matter particles. The ICs in `large_box` and `small_box` follow the same convention as in the Arepo ICs.
- AGORA_project: [Pluto](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebook for converting between initial conditions (IC) formats. It goes from a human readable `.dat` file (from the [AGORA](https://sites.google.com/site/santacruzcomparisonproject/data) project) to the binary format (`SnapFormat` = 2) or the HDF5 format (`SnapFormat` = 3), both for Gadget.
